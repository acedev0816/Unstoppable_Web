### Why Backup?

**This is an important reminder to always do a manual backup of your wallet.**

Your **Private Keys** are stored encrypted on your device and never leave your device. What this means is that, your keys are secured. The best way to backup your wallet is by manually writing down your Private Key on piece of paper.Â Thus, **no online service can then capture your wallet information.**

The Unstoppable Wallet team has NO record of your Private Keys.
