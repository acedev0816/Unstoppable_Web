# What are cryptocurrency transaction fees?

### What are Network Fees?

Every time you send any cryptocurrency, from your address to another, you incur a Network Transaction fee, also referred to as a Network fee. Making trades on exchanges also require fees for every buy or sell transaction.

The actual fee you pay will vary according to the network you use. For example, a Bitcoin transaction will have a different fee in comparison to transactions placed on the Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum or Litecoin network. There are even tokens that require a secondary or “gas” token to pay the network fees.

### Why is there a need for Network Fees?

Throughout-put of blockchain networks are limited. For example Bitcoin network can process approximately 400,000 transactions per day. On some days Bitcoin can be quite popular but since capacity is limited, transactions start to compete among each other. Miners who process transactions thus will pick the highest paying transaction to get processed first, since Miners are the ones who collect and benefit from those fees. On the days when popularity is low, transaction fees can even drop to zero. 

Basically, it is a way to prioritize transactions for a limited processing capacity.

### How are the Fees Calculated?

Fees can fluctuate depending on market demand and network capacity. The amount you pay per transaction is determined by how much you’re willing to spend. The more you pay the faster your transaction is processed. For those who are paying less, their transactions are set aside until the miners do not see higher priority transactions.

Determining fees can be a bit of a challenge, due to the way Bitcoin works. The price you pay depends on a number of factors including the size in kilobytes i.e the amount of data that makes up the transaction. That’s why SegWit sends are generally cheaper: because you’re transmitting less data over the network.
