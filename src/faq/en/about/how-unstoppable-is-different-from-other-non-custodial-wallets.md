It's the most sophisticated non-custodial wallet app to date that goes beyond non-custodial storage capabilities and takes a comprehensive approach towards privacy, decentralization and usability.

- Built per security best practices.
- Fully private. No user data stored.
- Decentralized blockchain communication.
- Supports unlimited number of multi-coin wallets.
- Decentralized Finance enabled wallet.
- Open source wallet.
- Educates users on crypto and DeFi.
- Natively built for iOS/Android.
- Audited by external parties.

When using a non-custodial wallet like Unstoppable the control over funds and access to them doesn't depend on any intermediary. The user has unconditional control over funds.

Most wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex are of custodial type. These are not real cryptocurrency wallets and do not provide any level of independence, privacy or control over the funds.

The users of these wallets:

- fully dependent on exchange to access their funds.
- can lose access to wallets at sole discretion of exchange.
- can lose their funds if exchange gets compromised.
- have very little control over privacy.
- have to go through KYC/AML procedures.
