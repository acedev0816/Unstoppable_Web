It's the most sophisticated non-custodial wallet app to date that goes beyond non-custodial storage capabilities and takes a comprehensive approach towards privacy, decentralization and usability.

- Built per security best practices.
- Fully private. No user data stored.
- Decentralized blockchain communication.
- Supports unlimited number of multi-coin wallets.
- Educates users on crypto/DeFi.
- A Decentralized Finance enabled wallet.
- Open source wallet.
- Natively built for iOS/Android.
- Audited by external parties.

When a user uses a non-custodial wallet like Unstoppable the control over funds and access to them doesn't depend on any entity. The user has unconditional and uninterruptible access to funds.

On the other hand, most of the wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex are of custodial type. These are not real cryptocurrency wallets and do not provide any level of independence, privacy or control over the funds.

The users of these wallets:

- fully dependent on exchange to be able to access their funds.
- can lose access to their wallet at sole discretion of exchange.
- can lose their funds if exchange gets hacked.
- have little control over their privacy.
- have to go through KYC/AML procedures
