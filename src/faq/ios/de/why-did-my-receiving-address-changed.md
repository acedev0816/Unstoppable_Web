# Why did my receiving address changed?

Receive address for certain tokens keeps changing after it was used once (funds were received once). For example this is true for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, but not for Ethereum. 

The reason to keep changing Receive address is to increase privacy mostly. But all previous addresses stay valid, and any funds sent to any of your addresses will be received by you.
