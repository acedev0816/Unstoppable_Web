# How to buy/sell cryptocurrency for fiat in Unstoppable?

Unstoppable doesn't support buying or selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency (USD, EUR etc) either directly or via 3rd party partners. 

There is no way to integrate such features without making the app significantly less private or without enabling this feature for some and excluding it for others.

For those looking to discover ways to purchase cryptocurrency in large amounts using fiat currencies we outline various reliable options in the Academy section of the wallet app.
