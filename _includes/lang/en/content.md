## Independent

The BANK wallet is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. It can't be stopped, blocked or taken down.

The wallet connects directly to the currency networks i.e. Bitcoin without the need for intermediary. Such approach enables the BANK wallet to operate anywhere and remain censorship-resistant.


## Decentralized

Most crypto wallet are centralized. The funds are stored on a remote server which is operated by the wallet provider. Due to the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrencies there are no mechanisms in place to guarantee that a wallet provider doesn't cheat or that provider's servers not get hacked.

Being a fully decentralized app the BANK wallet implements all of its functionality in a decentralized manner. Every single feature in the app is implemented in a decentralized manner substantially increasing the security and privacy aspects of the wallet.

There are no centrally managed servers that can fail, and as a result stop app from functioning.


## Secure

The BANK wallet stores user's private keys and funds encrypted on a device itself using secure native storage mechanisms provided by iOS/Android operating systems. Only user can access and use his or her funds.

In case of a device loss or replacement the user may easily restore the wallet using a secret 12-word recovery phrase. Infact, with the help of these secret phrase the user may restore the wallet and access funds on any deterministic wallet (aka HD wallet) not just the BANK wallet.


## Open Source

The entire code of the BANK wallet is public and open-source, giving an option for anyone to analyze all of its code. It works exactly as shown in the code. It can't cheat!

The BANK wallet is open source and available under the terms of the MIT License.

## Disclaimer

1. This Wallet is in its early days and just like any other software product it may have undiscovered issues which may potentially result in wallet having problems. While the wallet has been thoroughly tested over and over no one can say for sure that it's error-free. That said, we at Horizontal Systems believe it to be very secure, more than any cryptocurrency app out there.

2. DO NOT EVER install the BANK wallet on a jailbroken or tempered device due to substantial security risks. A jailbroken iOS/Android cannot guarantee the security of your private keys. This means that some malicious app running on jailbroken device can potentially access the private keys for your funds and steal them.
